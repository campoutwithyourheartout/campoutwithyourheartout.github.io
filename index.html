							<h2>Hayley</h2>
							<hr>
						</header>

						<p>Hello, I’m Hayley. I’m a laid back introvert that lives in Pleasant Hill, CA with two roommates, 2 dogs, Villa and Bailey, and my two kitties, Munchies and Cannoli. I was born and raised in California, where I love the winters, and dread the summers. I’ve been working as a medical alert dog tHayleyer for Dogs4Diabetics for a little over a year, and I hope to be there for many years to come. Outside of working, I enjoy vegging on the couch with my 2 dogs, travelling, hiking, camping, and finding good food to eat. </p>

						<p>I met Dayvon while playing World of Warcraft. I was spamming general chat with a guild spam message and he happened to whisper me. We had been looking for a hunter to join our raid, and it was between him and another hunter. Even though he did worse in his trial run with us, our guild leader chose him because he could sing. </p>

						<h3>How I Knew</h3>
						<p>I didn’t know, for a very long time. I’d say my feelings for him were a slow burn. There were a few times that I actually hated him and didn’t want to be his friend. But he stuck to me like a thorn in my side. He was there for me through my worst and with me through my best. There’s something to be said about a person that sticks through thick and thin. It took awhile to get there, but he grew on me and on a drunken night of drinking raspberry champagne in a hotel room on my friend’s boyfriends birthday trip to Disneyland, I asked him if he wanted to try being in a relationship. I never thought I would be getting married 5 years after that moment, but here we are, and it couldn’t be to the best man in the world.</p>

							<h2>Dayvon</h2>
							<hr>
						</header>

						<p>Hello! I'm Dayvon, born and raised in the PNW.  Currently I live in a house full of awesome people and The Actual Best Dog Blue, Cats Fudge and Cookie Cat, and various small critters. I spend my free time with video games, Blue, and going weird places to eat weird things! Most of my time is taken up by work as a Reservations Agent with Alaska Airlines, I've got big dreams and I'm not throwing away my shot!</p>

						<p>I met Hayley in World of Warcraft way back in 2010. I remember exactly where I was in the game world when I saw her invitation to the guild. On one of my early visits in the bay we were wandering somewhere in Berkeley in a dark, quiet and cool winter night, and I knew. Everything she did from then on had a deeper meaning. Ever since then I have been trying to be the best me that I can be. Every day that I have known Hayley has changed me for the better.</p>

						<h3>How I Knew</h3>
						<p>There are far too many times I stepped back and thought “ holy moly this person is literally amazing” for me to pinpoint when I knew I wanted to be with Hayley forever. Could it be how perfectly thoughtful Hayley is? Could to be all the times she sneakily bought me food when I was going hungry? Or how many times she has taken me to fabulous places? Could it be the hours spent jammed on to a tiny couch watching ratatouille? No matter how long I think, I can’t find that “one thing” or that one moment. That one moment is my life, from here on out.</p>
